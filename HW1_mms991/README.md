Creating reproducible research code chunk.

Using a set seed to generate random numbers from the Normal distribution,
I created a code chunk that generates a 50 x 2 x 100 array of numbers.

From there I attempted to plot each slice on a common grid, where the x-axis
contained numbers from column 1 in any given slice and the y-axis contained 
numbers from column 2 in any given slice. I tried to use a for loop to overlay each slice.

However, I am/was not familiar enough with python to figure out how to index an array by slice and plot
them on one graph.
