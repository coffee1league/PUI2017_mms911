Homework 2

I worked with Bianca Brusco (bb1569) and Gokmen Dedemen (gd1097) on assigments 1 through 3.
Bianca wrote the code for Jupyter notebook in assignment 3 and wrote independent code for assigment 1.
Gokmen wrote indpendent code for both assignment 1 and 2.

We all reviewed and discussed the code for each assigment, contributing small changes throughout.
The code I submitted for these assigments were not from original and largely drew on the code written by Bianca and Gokmen.
(I did write some code for assignments independently though I did not submit this [I am having some technically difficulties].)

## Assignment 1 and 2:
For assignment, we were tasked to pull MTA bus data for a given line from the API available on the MTA's website.
The goal was to create code that took arguments submitted via python scripts that would execute and produce the following results:
 - the number of active buses for a given line and it's location information (Latitude and Longitude) for assignment 1, taking as input a user's
 	API key stored as an environmental variable on their device and the requested bus line

 - information about the status of a bus at stops along a specified route a bus line. This scrip queries data from the MTA, filters down to the relevant information, and then saves/writes out a csv file of the desired results. The csv file is named as the third argument in the command line/python script call.

 ## Assingment 3
 Our task for this assignment was to fetch data from NYC Open data. We created a Jupyter notebook that plotted some data from a dataset as a scatterplot.
