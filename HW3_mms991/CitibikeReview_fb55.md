** Nully hypothesis and alternative **

Your idea:
Research question: Do subscribers take shorter trips than customers?
suggests a one-tailed experiment: your expected effect is that subscribers take tstrictly shorter trips,

but your null/alt are formu;ated as for a one-tailed: 

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference between the mean trip duration (d) for subscribers compared to the mean trip duation for customers. $$H_{0}: \bar{d}_{sub} = \bar{d}_{cus}$$
Alternative Hypothesis: The mean trip duration (d) for subscribers is not equal to the mean trip duration for customers. $$H_{0}: \bar{d}_{sub} \neq \bar{d}_{cus} $$   

This should be corrected and the idea should be made consistent with the nulll/alt or vice versa. 

State your significane level.

** Data ** 

the data seems parsed correctly and supports the question, the box plots help getting an intuition for the problem

**test **

Since you are testing a difference between means, the z-test would be the easieset solution. however this is a parametri test that assumes normality. 
ANOVA is an alternatie way to measure differene of means but also assumes normality (of the residuals) 

A non parametric test for differene between means is the Mann Whitney U test
