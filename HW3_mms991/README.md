### Homework 3
## Group members:
	Bianca Brusco
	Gokmen Dedemen
	Michael Sampson

For all three assignments I collaborated with the members in this group.

# Assignment 1
	I did some of the code on my own but checked out Bianca's and Professor Federica's code to verify some of the steps.

# Assignment 2
	I did some of the code on my own but definitely checked Gokmen's and Bianca's (and the professor's) code to see how to frame the hypotheses, grab the data from the Citi Bike. For the plotting I relied heavily on Seaborn's documentation.

# Assignment 3
	I worked on this problem with Bianca (who already had most of the code written from class). We mosty verified the wording of the hypotheses and 
	checked that our values were close or the same.
