## Assignment 1
I worked independently on this assigment. I drew from a Poisson distribution and showed that the Z-scores follow a gaussian distribution.

## Assignment 2
I used Bianca code for this assignment and reviewed the code with her.

## Assignment 3
Most of this code was created by Bianca and Gokmen. We met to review the code. I contributed modifications to some of the code, particulary some of the statistical questions. In this assignment we worked on creating regression models for data on mass murders and firearm possession.
