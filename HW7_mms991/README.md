## Assignment 1
Our project examined how trip duration varied by customer type for Citi Bike users. Specifically, we were interested in seeing if subscribers, customers who hold yearly memberships, took a greater proportion of shorter than average trips compared to customers, people who purchased one- or three-day passes. We coded our analysis in python and wrote up the results in Authorea. Our results suggest that subscribers take a greater proporotion of shorter trips than customers.

Bianca created the initial Authorea document and put in a large portion of the text and figures.
Gokmen, after reviewing the initial document, uploaded additional figures and edited some text.
I reviewed the text and figures for accuracy and made edits to the text and figures where necessary.

## Assignment 2
We reviewed the basic commands of SQL within the CARTO interface. We were introduced to the realational database model and practiced using CARTO to create maps from data. The lab goes over how to query Carto using sql functions.
