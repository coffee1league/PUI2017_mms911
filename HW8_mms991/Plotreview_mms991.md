Review of plot by mms991: This plot summarizes the number and types of issues that occured in five NYC Parks in Fiscal 2016. The bar graph is clear and uses consistent color codes based with regards to the category of complaints or issues. The plot has a clear title, and the X & Y axis are clearly labeled with units. The X axis provides labels for the different parks and since the bar graphs are plotted in the same plot it is straight forward to compare them against each other visually. Overall, the plot is sized well and visually clear; the grid lines are helpful as well in identifying the raw totals. One idea for a future graph might be to plot the complaints as a porportion or percentage of the total number of complaints per park in order to be able to compare the measures. The plots also made me currious to know how popular is each park in terms of population flow or attedance to contextualize the number of complaints received.  Overall a great plot.
