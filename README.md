# PUI2017_mms911
To set up the environment I first created a repository, PUI2017_mms911, on line on Github.
I then followed the instructions to link the repo created on online with my machine.
Next, I added the screenshots of creating an environmental variable and alias to my repo using git add, commit and push commands.

The screenshots are below:
